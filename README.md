# Personalised_Healthcare_recommendation_system


Developed an intelligent healthcare recommendation system that provides personalized health advice by analyzing user-provided symptoms. The system integrates AI models to suggest potential diagnoses, preventive care tips, and follow-up actions tailored to individual user profiles. Designed with a focus on accessibility and usability, the solution enhances early detection and proactive health management, especially for users in remote or underserved areas. This project was further recognized through publication in the International Conference on Innovations in Engineering and Technology (ICIET-24), NIER, for its contribution to remote health monitoring and patient-centered care.
